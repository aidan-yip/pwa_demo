        <h2>How PWAs actually work</h2>
        <div class="p-c-list">
          <p>
            At its core, Progressive Web Apps are created with HTML, CSS and
            Javascript. But what makes them unique is the way that they use
            caching. Normally when someone access the average website, the
            content and data from the site are retrieved by making HTTPS
            requests, but the main benefit of PWA's is that they can be used
            offline, and they do that through the process of caching the apps
            resources on the device, so there's no need to make a request to the
            server.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Service Workers</h3>
        <div class="p-c-list">
          <p>
            The technology that powers PWAs are called service workers. A
            service worker acts as a powerful background script that enhances
            the app's performance, reliability, and user experience. It
            intercepts network requests, enabling the app to cache resources and
            serve them locally, even when the user is offline or has a weak
            connection. Service workers also are behind the caching system that
            allows PWAs to be used offline. There is a 'life cycle' that makes
            use of different event listeners that each do a specific role to
            enable caching, background synchronization, and notifications in
            PWAs. These are the Install event, Activate event, Fetch event, Sync
            event, and Push event.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Install Event</h3>
        <div class="p-c-list">
          <p>
            The install event in service workers is triggered when the browser
            installs the service worker. It's commonly used to cache critical
            resources, also known as 'pre-caching', ensuring the app works
            offline or loads faster. Developers typically use event.waitUntil()
            with the Cache API to store files during this phase, preparing the
            app for future use.
            <br />
            This JavaScript code registers a service worker (sw.js) for a web
            app to enable offline capabilities. It checks for browser support,
            attempts to register the service worker within the specified scope
            ("/"), and logs its installation state or any errors that occur
            during registration.
          </p>

          <img
            src="./images/install-event.png"
            alt="code for the install event of the service worker."
          />

          <!-- <pre><code>
            // Register the service worker as a background process to cache the app for offline use.
            const registerServiceWorker = async () => {
              // Check if the browser supports service workers
              if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
                // Register the service worker
                try {
                  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register(
                    // Path to the service worker file that is to be registered
                    "sw.js",
                    {
                      // define the scope of the service worker
                      scope: "/",
                    }
                  );
                  // Check the state of the service worker and log it to the console
                  if (registration.installing) {
                    console.log("Service worker installing");
                  } else if (registration.waiting) {
                    console.log("Service worker installed");
                  } else if (registration.active) {
                    console.log("Service worker active");
                  }
                  // if the registration fails, log it to the console
                } catch (error) {
                  console.error(`Registration failed with ${error}`);
                }
              }
            };
            
            // Call the registerServiceWorker function on page load
            registerServiceWorker();
        </code></pre> -->
        </div>

        <h3>Caching and Pre-caching</h3>
        <div class="p-c-list">
          <p>
            Caching in a PWA provides local storage for essential assets and
            resources, acting as an "offline backup" to fetch content when the
            network is unavailable. Pre-caching prepares these assets in
            advance, typically during the install event, ensuring they are ready
            when needed. A common strategy is cache-first, where resources are
            retrieved from the cache if available; otherwise, the network is
            used.
